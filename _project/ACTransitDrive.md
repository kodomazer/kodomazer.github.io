AC Transit: Drive is a game that I worked on in the Spring of 2017 as part of Game Studio 2.  I joined the team as an engineer and worked to rapidly fix the problems we were left with from the first semester of work and develop new mechanics to complete the game.

My main focus within AC Transit was to work on the back ends of the bus, the player "character," and the in game store for purchasing new skins for the bus.  I was also the git guru, working to maintain the health of the git repository and helping the rest of the team with problems.
