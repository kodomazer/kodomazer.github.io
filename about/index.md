title: About Me
---
I'm Brian Zhao and I go to Cogswell Polytechnical College studying to be a Game Design Engineer, though I'm much more focused on the Engineering side of things than design.  I have nearly a decade of experience in programming across a whole host of languages, from C to C# and Python to Javascript.  I'm well read in various code design methods and am always learning new things.  This allows me to be adaptable and able to function in any development environment.
