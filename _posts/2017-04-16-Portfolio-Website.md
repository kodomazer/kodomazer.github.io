title: Portfolio Website Started
---

This is my portfolio website.  I've pieced it together with Jekyll, HTML, and CSS.  In doing so I've mucked about with Ruby, Unix, and various command line components.

This is a work in progress as of this post as I work to piece together basic pages to showcase the projects that I've worked on.  Currently the projects don't even have pictures to go along with them, those will come online with the next update most likely, after I've had a chance to rebuild some of the older projects and get screenshots.
